#ConnectFour

*A Connect Four game with two-player, single-player, and zero-player playability.*

The game is run by accessing Connect Four>andrew>Game.java

To start the game, first select player type and input player names (if necessary). For non-automated players (i.e. humans), select a column (0-6) to drop pieces in. The game ends just like regular Connect-Four: when a player achieves four-in-a-row of their respective number, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

There are three player class selection: random, human, and computer.

Random - automated. Drops pieces randomly.

Human - Allows for user-inputed selection on where to drop pieces.

Computer - automated. Detects win-loss conditions and strategies. Plays adaptively based on position.
